        <p><strong>Lion</strong> <br> The lion (Panthera leo) is a large, muscular carnivorous mammal belonging to the
            Felidae family. Often referred to as the "king of the jungle," lions are actually native to grasslands,
            savannas, and open woodlands in Africa and a small population in India. Males are distinguished by their
            thick, flowing manes, which vary in color from golden to dark brown and serve as a display of strength and
            dominance. Females, known as lionesses, lack manes but are highly skilled hunters, relying on teamwork to
            bring down prey such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo.
         <hr>
            Lions are highly social animals, living in groups called prides, which typically consist of related females,
            their offspring, and one or a few dominant males. These prides establish and defend territories, often
            marked by loud roars that can be heard from miles away. Males primarily defend the pride, while females do
            most of the hunting, although males often take the first share of the kill.
         <hr>
            Lions are apex predators but face threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Their
            lifespan in the wild ranges from 10 to 15 years, while those in captivity may live over 20 years. Despite
            their formidable nature, lions also face competition from other large predators, such as hyenas, which
            sometimes challenge them for food.
         <hr>
            Lions symbolize strength, courage, and leadership in many cultures, appearing in myths, flags, and coats of
            arms throughout history. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure
            their survival in the wild.</p>
